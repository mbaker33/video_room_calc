### Release Notes:

**v0.1.502**
- Full URL now in address bar and updated with changes. Copying address bar is similar to clicking on Shareable Link.
- Shareable Link now copies a hyperlink that is name of the room.  If the room does not have a name then "Video Room Calculator" is used.
- RoomOS QR code now automatically updates with changes. The QR code is designed for RoomOS but is accessible in browsers by adding '&qr' to query string parameter.  Updates are delayed 1 second for performance reasons.
- Improvements to Quick Setup menu to keep confusing things from happening.

**v0.1.5**- 
Huge update.  
- Drag and drop.
- Multiple Microphones.
- Multiple Cameras.
